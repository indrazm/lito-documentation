# Lito

Litojs is an open-source, full-stack JavaScript framework designed for practicality and ease of use, drawing inspiration from established frameworks like Django and Laravel. It offers a comprehensive set of features to facilitate web application development, including database models with LitoORM, as well as authentication, authorization, APIs, and controllers.

While there are many JavaScript frameworks available, many still require developers to install multiple packages and create their own solutions for authentication, authorization, and other functionalities. Although flexibility is valuable in development, having a framework that covers all necessary aspects of app building can simplify the process significantly.

Similar to Django and Laravel, Lito aims to save developers time by providing an all-in-one solution. With just the command-line tool, developers can quickly get started without the need to piece together various components.
