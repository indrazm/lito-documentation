# Philosophy of Lito

At its core, Lito represents a pragmatic approach to web development, merging the richness of JavaScript with the simplicity and efficiency best exemplified by frameworks like Django and Laravel. Our underlying philosophy is rooted in the belief that the developer experience should be seamless, intuitive, and productive, allowing developers to focus on what truly matters: bringing their ideas to life.

### Simplicity and Completeness

In a world overflowing with various JavaScript frameworks, we recognize the challenge of navigating through myriad packages and configurations. Each framework offers unique strengths, but the burden of assembling the necessary tools often outweighs the benefits. With Lito, we aim to challenge that notion. Our guiding principle is that simplicity should not come at the cost of completeness.

Lito is designed to be a full-stack solution that comes "battery-included," meaning that all essential features – from database modeling with LitoORM to robust authentication and authorization systems – are readily available. We believe in minimizing the overhead developers face when starting a new project, allowing them to concentrate on building meaningful applications rather than wrestling with setup and configuration.

### Empowering Developers

Flexibility is an important aspect of development, but it should not equate to complexity. While the modern developer needs control and adaptability, they shouldn't have to reinvent the wheel or spend unnecessary hours piecing together disparate components. Lito provides a cohesive ecosystem, where developers can swiftly leverage built-in functionalities while maintaining the power to extend and customize their applications as needed.

By adopting a methodology similar to that of Django and Laravel, we aspire to save developers valuable time. Our user-friendly CLI tool is designed to get developers up and running quickly, minimizing the learning curve and ensuring a smooth onboarding process.

### A Framework for All

Lito is not just a framework; it is a statement that development should be inclusive and approachable. We are dedicated to making the web development journey enjoyable for both seasoned professionals and newcomers alike. By embracing best practices and fostering a supportive community, we hope to inspire confidence in developers, equipping them with the tools they need to create exceptional web applications.

In essence, the philosophy of Lito encapsulates a commitment to simplicity, empowerment, collaboration, and inclusivity. With Lito, we aim to redefine the landscape of JavaScript frameworks, making it easier than ever to turn innovative ideas into reality.
